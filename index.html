      <h1>Selin Erguncu, PhD</h1>
      <h2>Postdoctoral Researcher at USC</h2>
      <p>
        I obtained my PhD in Marketing (2015) from Koc University, Istanbul and BSc in Industrial Engineering (2009) from Istanbul Technical University. I spent two quarters as a visiting scholar at UCLA during my PhD. My research is in consumer decision-making, behavioral economics, marketing strategy, and social media. I have won an Marketing Science Institute research grant and a Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative data competition for my research.
        <br><br>
        Currently I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in USC Marshall School of Business, and a Research Associate in USC Marshall Center for Global Innovation.
